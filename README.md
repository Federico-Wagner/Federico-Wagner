## Hi there, I'm Federico Wagner 👋  

I'm a **Backend Developer**, passionate about building scalable, secure, and well-structured applications.  

Currently, I'm leading the design and implementation of a **Microservices Architecture Project** — a Virtual Wallet platform built with **Spring Boot, Docker, Loki, Fluent Bit, Grafana** — focused on mastering **observability, distributed tracing, security, and CI/CD pipelines**.  
This project represents my path toward becoming a **Senior Backend Engineer**, combining my technical curiosity with solid engineering principles.
